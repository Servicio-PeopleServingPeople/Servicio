                Do you ever think how many people suffer because of hunger? 45%
                of all child deaths worldwide are from causes related to
                undernutrition(WHO). It's affecting the kids most as they
                are in the stage of growing and developing. We can all stop
                world hunger together by donating food to charities and
                organisations that work to prevent world hunger.

                Over the past few years, the world has woken up to horrifying headlines about sea life that has unfortunately died due to consuming 
                or being trapped by the waste we throw in the oceans. 
                Beaches are diverse, natural treasures that are here for all of us to explore and enjoy. 
                Unfortunately, trash on our beaches jeopardizes these shared natural treasures. 
                By cleaning up the beaches, people from all over the world can enjoy beaches fully.

                Garbage Cleanup is a much-needed service that not only protects the public but safeguards the environment from the harmful effects of solid waste. Proper garbage collection and disposal facilitates improved recycling, lessens the impact on landfills, and protects the environment through effectively controlling the pollutants and contaminants that are released.

                Currently, at least half of the people in the world do not receive the health services they need. About 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket spending on health. This must change.
                To make health for all a reality, we need: individuals and communities who have access to high quality health services so that they take care of their own health and the health of their families; skilled health workers providing quality, people-centred care; and policy-makers committed to investing in universal health coverage.
